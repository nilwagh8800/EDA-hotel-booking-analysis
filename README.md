# EDA-hotel-booking-analysis

# Problem Statement
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

# Business Objective
Analyse the data on bookings of City Hotel and Resort Hotel to gain insights on the different factors that affect the booking.

# Project Summary 
1. I began to explore the dataset in which Hotel Booking comprises of two types of hotels i.e City Hotel and Resort Hotel.
2. there are both duplicates and missing values available. So, i have to deal with that and as a result i have replaced the null and missing values and also i dropped the duplicate values.
3. I divided the data manipulation workflow into three categories i.e. Data Collection, Data cleaning & manipulation and EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).
4. I have used various basic functions and attributes i.e Data collections first step to find different columns which is done by various methods like Head(), tail(), info(), describe(), columns() and some others method used for data collections.
5. I check the number of unique values of each columns and generate a list of those values.
6. I converted the datatypes of columns into appropriate datatype. I added some of the columns.
7. Before visualizing any data from the data set we have to do data wrangling. For that, i have checked the null value of all the columns. After checking, when i find minimal number of null values, filling these null values with necessary values as per requirement by using fillna().
8. So, after completing the process of data wrangling, i moved to the data visualization part.
9. In the data visualization process, i have used various charts and have dived deep understanding the graphs to catch the proper insights from the data. That gives the business outcomes which will ultimately boost the businesses.

# Solution to Business Objective
1. We are able achieve the same by showing the client which are the months are high in revenue generation by using various charts and graphs distribution.
2. Enhancing the revenue adopted by bar chart distribution of which type room are most preferred and reserved and which are the months suitable for visitors.
